These two script can be used to clean up old machine accounts in Active Directory.

You could run find_old_machines_by_lastlogon.ps1 which will disable machine accounts that are
older than 21 days, but haven't booted on the network in the last 60 days.

It will email the list of computers that are disabled. 

You can then run Delete_disabled_computer_Accounts.ps1 at a later time to delete all disabled computer accounts.

Im my scenario, I'd delete disabled accounts 30 days after they were disabled.

A future version of this script had the ability to exclude machines based on a tag
of some sort in the description field. I lost that version, but it would be easily implemented again.
